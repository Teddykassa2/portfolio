			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello everyone, My name is Teddy. I was and raised in Ethiopia. I have 6 years experience in the medical as a caregiver but I’ve always been interested in the tech field so I joined Year Up in the APP Dev track. With  zero experience in programming . Year Up covered introductions to a few programming languages and gave us the skills to be able to learn our on. I’ve learned a lot within the last 6 months of my internship. Some of the main tools I’ve learned are Phantom, Conductor. As well as python and terraform..</p>

				<h3>Case Study: Cybersecurity at JP Morgan Chase</h3>
			</article>
			<h3>Background:
                Our client is a large financial institution that is committed to ensuring the security of its customers' data. They utilize Splunk SOAR Phantom to automate their security operations and streamline their incident response process. However, they faced a challenge with their current setup. The existing Phantom Playbook, written in Python, was inefficient, and they needed a skilled backend cybersecurity engineer to help optimize the playbook.</h3>
            <h3>Issues/Problems:
                The existing Phantom Playbook took a long time to execute, which resulted in significant downtime for the client. Additionally, the playbook did not effectively automate certain tasks, leading to a high volume of false positives that the security team had to manually review. As a result, the client's security team was overwhelmed with alerts and was struggling to respond to legitimate threats quickly.</h3>
            <h3>Process/Actions/Decisions:
                To address the client's issues, our team of backend cybersecurity engineers conducted a thorough analysis of their existing playbook. We identified several areas for improvement, including:
                <ul>
                <li>Code Optimization: We rewrote the code to make it more efficient, reducing the playbook's execution time significantly.</li>
                <li>Playbook Streamlining: We streamlined the playbook by removing redundant steps and automating tasks that were previously manual.</li>
                <li>False Positive Reduction: We implemented additional checks and filters to reduce the number of false positives, allowing the security team to focus on legitimate threats.</li>
                <li>Integration with Existing Tools: We integrated the playbook with the client's existing security tools, such as SIEM and EDR solutions.</li>
                Throughout the process, we worked closely with the client to ensure that our solutions aligned with their needs and requirements.
                </ul>
             </h3>   
            <h3>Work:
                We used Python to write the optimized Phantom Playbook for the client. We leveraged Splunk SOAR's extensive library of pre-built actions and integrations to automate various tasks, such as blocking malicious IP addresses and quarantining compromised endpoints. We also used Splunk SOAR's custom scripting capabilities to tailor the playbook to the client's specific needs.</h3>
            <h3>Result:
                The result of our work was a highly efficient and effective Phantom Playbook that significantly improved the client's incident response process. The playbook's execution time was reduced from several hours to just a few minutes, enabling the security team to respond quickly to threats. False positives were also significantly reduced, freeing up the security team's time to focus on legitimate threats.
                The client was thrilled with the results of our work. They reported that our optimized playbook had saved them a significant amount of time and had improved their ability to detect and respond to security incidents quickly. They also noted that our integration with their existing security tools had improved their overall security posture. Our work helped the client achieve their goal of providing their customers with a secure banking experience.
                </h3>
